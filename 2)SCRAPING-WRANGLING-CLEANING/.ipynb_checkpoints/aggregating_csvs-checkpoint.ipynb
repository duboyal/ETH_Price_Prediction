    "Scraping 4 months worth of posts from an active subreddit resulted in quite a bit of data, where it was taxing on the API (would usually time out if I tried to scrape too much at a time) that scraping process needed to be chunked up, and incrementally output to csv files. The mulitple output files accumulated and this notebook was used to concatenate all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "please refer to the jupyter notebook \"scraping_reddit_posts\" to understand why we would have multiple ouput files to concatenate into a larger data frame. The ability to keep connection to the API was limited, and the scraping of data had to be done in steps therefore we had many outputfiles from these many steps."
