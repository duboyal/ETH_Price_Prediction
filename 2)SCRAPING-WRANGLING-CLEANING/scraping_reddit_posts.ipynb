    "Currently in this notebook, we have the \"second level comments\" option commented out. The reason for this is: was it was too taxing on the API since the density of posts were very high particularly for the bitcoin subreddit. It was found more efficient to scrape through first level comments first and second level comemnts after that if second level comments were infact desired. In the end we deemed second level comments to be unneccessary.\n",

    "'reddits' is a list that continuously gets appended to, each element a dictionary 'post_doc' that contains informational fields for post id post text, post time, etc. One thing to notice upon examining this block of code is that at the end of the function, we convert our list 'reddits' into a dataframe and then upon completion of the for loop, output that dataframe to a csv file with the integer 'i' in its filename. Here 'i' is the integer number of days since the original starting day we chose to begin scraping (every 86400 added to epoch time increases the timestamp by a full 24 hours.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway is that for whatever range of 'i' we choose to iterate over for this for loop will be the number of days scraped since our chosen starting date. hypothetically, we could manually change our range to go from 0 to 5 and it would cover 5 days worth. The execution of that range would result in 5 output csv files. However many iterations in the for loop will be the number of output files created.\n",
